# Final Project

The final project is to replicate the pipeline approach to data analysis on a topic of your choice.

Written proposal due date: Wednesday, April 19th

Project due date: Tuesday, May 9th

You may turn these in by email (galkamaxd at gmail) or in person at class.

### Deliverable:

The final deliverable should include:
- a web-based data visualization with a URL (public or private)
- a written description of the project, the results, and the technical methods used in each step (collection, storage, analysis and visualization)
- all code/spreadsheets/datasets used

### Task:

The project is open-ended. The topic and technologies used are up to you. However, the it must satisfy at least two of the items below:
- Data is collected through a means more sophisticated than downloading (e.g. scraping, API).
- At least one of the datasets contains more than 1,000,000 records.
- It combines data collected from 3 or more different sources.
- The analysis of the data is reasonably complex, involving multiple steps (geospatial queries, data shaping, data frame operations, etc).
- The data visualization includes a time component (e.g. moving parts, changing colors).
- The webpage includes a significant interactive component.

As a rough guideline, you should shoot for something that is 3-4 times as involved as the required assignments.

Group projects are permitted. You are also permitted to combine this assignment with one you are working on for another course. But keep in mind that if you choose either of these options, the expectations for the project's scope will be adjusted accordingly.

### Grading:

The project will be graded on three criteria:
- Concept: Is it sufficiently complex/challenging/sophisticated? Is the final product useful/interesting/novel?
- Technical implementation: Was it well thought out? Was each step done correctly?
- Visualization: How well does the data visualization serve its purpose? Does it tell a clear story? Are the colors/layout/titles well-chosen?
- Writeup: Is all of the above explained clearly in the written description?
